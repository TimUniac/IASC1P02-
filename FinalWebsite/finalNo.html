It seems like the messaging is either conflicting, or coming from frankly untrustworthy sources.  The media has always been out to control the way we think and act, so why would anyone trust them now when they're telling us to do something that seems so beyond our nature.  Also in the first few months of Covid, we were told expressly not to wear a mask.  Wearing a mask was selfish and keeping PPE from front line workers.  Why has the message suddenly changed so drastically?  PPE has become readily available.  So, as people return to their regular activities, wearing the available PPE, the same PPE that was and is needed to protect front line workers, allows them to do it in a safe manner.  Taking that one simple precaution of wearing a mask is<a href= "https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf">
proven</a> to limit the spread of Coivd19 drastically.  It’s not a magic bullet by any means, but it allows for people to safely go out and get groceries, or go to work.  This is something we can do to take back control during a time when it feels like everything is completely out of our control.  If everyone wore a mask we could save thousands of lives and reopen many parts of the economy that are currently too dangerous.  Please rethink your decision to not wear a mask.  <br/>
